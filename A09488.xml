         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe bee the particular canons required in all vowes; by all which if you will examine the forenamed Popiſh vowes as they are in uſe and practiſe amongſt them, wee ſhall finde them altogether repugnant to them, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unjuſtifiable, either in doctrine or in practiſe. But when vowes are regulated by theſe rules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, then may a Chriſtian lawfully vowe them, and beeing vowed muſt faithfully performe them.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond generall conſiderable in this vowe is <hi>Cui,</hi> the perſon to whom Iacob vowed this vowe: where it is remarkable that he doth not make it to any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels whom he ſaw aſcending and deſcending by the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reaching to heaven; but he makes his vow unto God, and that not to any of the Idol gods of the Gentiles, but to the God of his forefathers, who appeared unto him on the top of the ladder, and made ſo large and loving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of love and protection unto him.</p>
            <p>And indeede in thus vowing did Iacob vowe aright; for howſoever the making of vowes bee no eſſentiall part of Gods worſhip, binding all men to performe them; yet when they are made, they may not without ſacriledge bee made to any but God alone.</p>

            <p>From all which particular requeſts of Iacob, we may briefly obſerve theſe generall inſtructions following:</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:14963:12"/>And thus come we to the laſt generall part of this text, namely, the matter of Iacobs vowe, or the things particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly vowed; <hi>Then ſhall the Lord bee my God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which generall, Iacob vowes 3 particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That the Lord ſhall bee his God. 2. That that pil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar ſhould bee called Gods houſe. 3. Becauſe Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice could not be performed without mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, hee vowes that of all whatſoever God ſhould give him, he would ſurely give a tenth unto God againe. In the firſt hee vowes inward, in the two latter outward worſhip; in the firſt hee vowes himſelfe, in the two latter his labour and goods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then ſhall the Lord be my God:</hi> that is, then will I feare God, and him above all; then will I love God, and him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all; then will I acknowledge God to bee the gui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, governour, and giver of all things; of whome I have received whatſoever I ſhall poſſeſſe: and as I will put my truſt in him and him alone; ſo will I pray unto him, and him onely for whatſoever I ſhal neede. This I take to be the ſenſe and meaning of the words in generall. Neither muſt wee underſtand theſe words ſpoken <hi>de futuro</hi> onely, as if Iacob did not in preſent acknowledge the Lord for his God; but Iacob vowing this particular, vowes the performance of a double duty neceſſary to bee obſerved in the practiſe of all Chriſtians in the manner of rendring thankes to God for his bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Firſt, with what kinde of worſhip hee would firſt and principally labour to manifeſt his thankefulnes; namely, as he begged firſt at Gods hands for ſpirituall bleſſings, ſo he would principally labour to manifeſt the truth of his thankefulnes by rendring unto God the inward devotion and ſpirituall worſhip of his heart and ſoule, as being that which God principally requires, and without which all the duties wee performe are no waies pleaſing unto him, he beeing, as Saint Ambroſe well obſerveth, <hi>non corticis

            <p>The ſecond objection is made againſt the Miniſters maintenance, and that not in generall; for there is none ſo impiouſly ſacrilegious, that will denie (at leaſt in words) the neceſſity thereof; but the queſtion is about the rule of proportion and law, whereby they are due to God, and from him to his Miniſters; whether by the Divine Morall law of God, or by vertue of humane lawes and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conſtitutions; whether <hi>ſecundum totam,</hi> a proportion anſwerable to the Leviticall Prieſthood, or whether <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quotam,</hi> in the ſame full due &amp; kinde as they were paid to the Leviticall Prieſthood.

as being a Ceremoniall or Iudiciall law, tying men to the paiment thereof during onely the time of the Leviticall Prieſthood, and continuance of the Iewiſh Politie, is moſt falſe and erroneous. And that I ſpeake no more then I ſhal be able to proove, I will lay downe three Concluſions;</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the law for paiment of the tithe was not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Ceremoniall or Iudiciall, binding the paiment onely to the Iewiſh Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the tenth is that proportion which is ſimply due unto Gods worſhip and ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the paiment of tithes for the <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ta</hi> is a Divine Morall law, yet ſtanding in force to binde all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to pay them unto the Evangelicall Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>That the law for paiment of tithes was never ſimply Ceremoniall &amp;c. is thus prooved;</p>
            <p>If the law binding to pay the tenth for the <hi>quota,</hi> were barely Ceremoniall or Iudiciall, then were tithes onely due to the Leviticall Prieſthood: but the tenth was not onely due to the Leviticall Prieſthood: <hi>ergò,</hi> &amp;c. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of the <hi>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or</hi> is undeniable, the <hi>minor</hi> is thus proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; That which of due was paid to another Prieſthood, and that by the Leviticall Prieſthood, was not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and due unto them: but tithes were paide by the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Prieſthood of due to another, even to him that was the type of the Evangelicall Prieſthood: therefore not due onely to the Levites. The <hi>minor</hi> is thus prooved; That which was paid by Abraham to Melchiſedeck, was paid by the Levites to another Prieſthood: but tithes were paid by Abraham to Melchiſedeck: <hi>ergò,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This argument Paul urgeth, Hebr. 7. where compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prieſthood of Chriſt with Aarons, he makes this one argument to proove Chriſt his Prieſthood the greater, in that Levi in Abraham paid tithes unto M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, I anſwer that both the text of Geneſis, Chap. 14. 20. and HEBR. 7. 2. ſpeake in generall tearmes, that Abraham gave tithes of all; and as for the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>By <hi>all places</hi> I underſtand, 1. <hi>the ſeverall and particular Kingdomes of Chriſtendome;</hi> not ſome one or fewe, but all 2. not ſome heathen, as the Romanes alone, or Grecian only, but both, nay all whoſoever are recorded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Deity or at leaſt we read of none that did not with out puniſhment; <hi>Quis enim aeſos impune putarit eſſe Deos?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:14963:21"/>But againſt this argument there are brought diverſe inſtances: firſt, againſt the practiſe of the heathen; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againſt the practiſe of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>For the heathen, theſe objections are made. 1. They had no compulſary law to compell them. 2. They paide not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seld. pag.</hi> 28</note> but arbitrarily. 3. They paid not annually, nor of all things, not to all Deities, nor by all men. For anſwer of all which, in a word; firſt, what needed they any law to compell them, when as they were a law to themſelves, drawne thereunto either by the law of nature, more force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then any humane law; or elſe by traditionall cuſtome from the practiſe of their forefathers, which to us is above all, and to them was alwaies in the nature and force of a law, they not having alwaies their lawes written (as we now) further then in the cuſtomary practiſe of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Secondly, for the making of lawes for the paiment of tithes, they well could not, in that they paid tithes to ſeverall Deities; ſo that to have made a law for one, had beene to draw the envy of another Deitie upon them. As for the ſecond, that they paid them not upon neceſſitie, but voluntarily, we ſhall finde the contrary confeſſed by the Tithes-Hiſtorian, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. where recording the vow of Cypſelus of Corinth, he ſaith that Cypſelus had ſpeciall regard to the tenth part of the goods of the Citizens, as competent to a Deitie; and in the ſame page (relateing out of Herodotus the practiſe of Cyrus) tells us that Cyrus being admoniſhed of Croeſus, would not have the goods of the Lydians ranſact by the ſouldiers, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they were <hi>neceſſarily</hi> to be tithed to Iupiter; and that not only as a vow, but as a cuſtome: otherwiſe (as Mr. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague obſerveth) it would have beene a poore argument to have made the ſouldiers deſiſt from their right in the ſpoile.</p>
            <p>And as for annuall paiment he confeſſeth, pag. 30. that it was a cuſtome to bring unto Apollo yearly firſt fruits in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14963:22"/>
tenths; and a little before, ſpeaking of the Syphnians, he ſaith that they gave yearely the tithes of their mines which they found in the Iſle. And Mr. Mountague further<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 493.</note> addeth, that when covetouſnes made them leave paying that tribute of tithes, the ſea brake in among them and ſwallowed up thoſe mines; a juſt vengeance of God upon detainers of divine right, by diſhonouring God to looſe all. And in the laſt place where he averreth all paid not, nor of all things, nor to all Deities, let him or any ſhew as much in the negative, as wee have ſhewed in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and we will yeeld the bucklers: and yet I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the proofe of a negative after the affirmative prooved, ſhould ſtand good againſt Gods right, that will not ſtand good againſt an earthly Kings, no not againſt the right of a private perſon.</p>
            <p>But graunt that all this were true that is alledged, that they paid not yearely, nor of all things &amp;c. Were they not heathen, in whome the light of nature being darkened, might faile in the perfect performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſuch things as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture required. Certainly if we faile, having a greater light, in the performance not onely of this duty, but of things of greateſt moment, eſpecially when gaine and profit come in our way, let us not expect perfection from them, though in naturall things; howſoever, what they did prooves the truth of my former concluſion, in that they paid neither an eighth, ninth, eleventh, or twelfth, but alwaies a ſtrict tenth, or at leaſt <hi>nomine decima;</hi> demonſtrating thereby the tenth to be due <hi>de jure,</hi> howſoever they failed <hi>de fallo</hi> to pay it in the full proportion or <hi>quota.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſons brought to infringe the practiſe of tithes under the Goſpel, are two; both taken from matter of fact. The firſt is the practiſe of the primitive Church in the daies of the Apoſtles, who neither received tithes, nor challenged them; together with the ſetling of the paiment of tithes in all particular countries where the Goſpel hath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14963:22"/>
been received; which paiments have been ſetled according to the particular lawes &amp; cuſtomes of particular countries.</p>
            <p>Firſt for anſwer, we ſay that <hi>a facto ad jus non valet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentia,</hi> it was not done thus and thus, and therefore it ought not to have been otherwiſe, is no good conſequence either in Logicke or Lawe, much leſſe in Divinitie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Church in thoſe times of the Apoſtles, and many yeares after, was not ſetled, but was in great perſecution, and ſo not a fit time for Miniſters to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in urgeing that queſtion, leaſt, as Saint Paul ſpake of himſelfe, they ſhould have ſeemed to have ſought <hi>theirs</hi> more then <hi>them.</hi> And to reaſon thus, we may as well ſay that the Iſraelites paid no tithes in the wildernes, nor in their captivities; therefore they were not due at any time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thoſe that were not converted paid according to their auncient cuſtomes unto their Idoll-Gods; thoſe that were, willingly brought all and laid them at the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles feete: but the Church was no ſooner ſetled, but tithes were demaunded, and readily by way of thankefulnes to God paid when and where the Goſpel was from time to time received and embraced, as the particular graunts ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Selden himſelfe will ſufficiently witneſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon oppoſing the practiſe for the times of the Goſpel, is grounded upon the doctrine of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and practiſe of the Church; firſt ſet abroach by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seld. p.</hi> 158.</note> Hales. Their doctrine was, that tithes for the <hi>quota</hi> are not due now in the time of the Goſpel; either by the Morall lawe, or the lawe of Nature; but onely <hi>jure Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> by the judiciall lawes and conſtitutions of the Church, beeing grounded upon the equitie of a mutuall diſtribution betwixt the Miniſters and the people; that as the one gives ſpirituall things, ſo the other ſhould afford unto them of their temporall things. The practiſe of the Church was in ſuffering the conveyances of Parochiall rites in tithes to bee diverted unto the maintenance of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14963:23"/>
Monkes and Friars in their cloyſters, which (ſaith the Tithes-Hiſtorian) the Church would never have ſuffered,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 159.</note> had they formerly held tithes due to be paid by divine right, either <hi>lege ſcriptâ,</hi> or <hi>natâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe reaſons to them that will underſtand reaſon, are eaſily anſwered; for firſt, the Schoolemen and Friars are contrary to themſelves and one to another, for which I referre the Reader to Gregory <hi>de Valentia</hi> in his Title of tithes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is the judgement of a few Monkes and Friars, who by their niceties and ſubtilties have obſcured the truth, rather then explained it, being compared with all the auncient Fathers of Gods Church in all ages, which have ſealed to the truth of their doctrine by ſhedding of their bloods?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let all honeſt Chriſtians conſider the end that theſe Schoolmen aimed at, with the miſerable event that followed their doctrine and practiſe. For their ends, they were two;</p>

The Apoſtles practiſed it after Chriſts aſcention and their receiving the holy Ghoſt, bleſſing the people with that Evangelicall forme of bleſſing mentioned 2. COR. 13. 14. <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the holy Ghoſt be with you all; Amen.</hi> According to which forme, the Miniſters of God in all ages ſince have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to bleſſe the people: the which forme, though it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in words from that uſed under the Lawe, yet is it the ſelfe ſame for ſenſe and ſubſtance: and that both more ſweete, by how much the ſweete name of IESVS is therein mentioned; as alſo more plaine, in that the three perſons of the bleſſed Trinitie are therein diſtinctly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, which in the other are onely cloſely implied under the triple iteration of the name and title of LORD.</p>

               </gap>e the Law commanding tithes for the <hi>quota</hi> to be abrogate, is to leave the Miniſters of the Goſpel without a certaine rule for maintenance: <hi>ergò</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>major</hi> is evident by two reaſons; 1. Becauſe mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is one of thoſe foure neceſſary duties required of all men towards their Miniſters now in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; the other three beeing <hi>loue, countenance, obedience.</hi> 2. In regard of thoſe manifold miſchieſes and inconveniences which muſt neceſſarily follow, in leaving them to a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtipende or contribution of man, without a certaine rule given by God himſelfe: as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Flatterie, or ſuſpition of flatterie, in beeing thought to have ſome perſons in admiration, becauſe of advantages which cannot be in tithes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſſimulation and deceit, in making as though they received little when as they have much; which cannot be in tithes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this meanes the poorer ſort are either much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced in regard of that little they haue, or elſe are forced to ſtraine themſelves above their abilitie to their utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, as wofull experience makes too evident in ſuch places where Miniſters live on contribution; whereas in the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tithes every man reſts content with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Oſtentation in ſome, in giving much, and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that give leſſe; which cannot be in tithes.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that all this may be amended by a ſett ſtipende ariſing from goods proper to the Church; I aske what they underſtand by Church goods: If they meane tithes which are the proper goods of the Church; how can any man proportion a ſtipende better then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath done, to give every Miniſter the tithes of thoſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14963:25"/>
people committed to his charge? If by goods proper to the Church, they underſtand ſuch voluntary offerings as ſhall be brought in by the faithfull into the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie of the Church, or otherwiſe ſhall bee rated by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon every particular perſon; then I demande what contribution can be ſo ſure, what ſtipend eſtabliſhed by man ſo certaine, but that either by the wickednes of the Magiſtrates who have power to eſtabliſh, or inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thoſe by whome it is bee paide, or covetouſnes of thoſe by whome it is to bee collected and gathered, is ſubject either to change, or elſe to enforce Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to the former evils: as is evident in all places, where Miniſters live either upon ſuch voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſet ſtipends. But more of this hereaſter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is thus prooved; If there bee a lawe or rule, it is for more, or leſſe, or the ſame certaine due; if it bee for more, why doe they withhold it? if for leſſe, then are we in worſe caſe then the Levi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If they ſay that Paul ſets downe a rule and law. 1. COR. 9. GAL. 6. 6. I ſay then, it is a divine lawe, not humane; for more honourable maintenance, not for leſſe: as all the reaſons plainely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the onely happines that our late gracious Soveraigne IAMES of bleſſed memorie, had in the remainder of thoſe holy things, was this, that he was ſo happie as to ridde the crowne of them; and from my ſoule I wiſh that (as I have often heard it was his deſire) ſo for Gods glory, his owne honour, the future happines of his poſterity, &amp; of his kingdomes, he had been ſo further happy as to have reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gods part in his tenths unto the Church againe.

            <p>Further, it muſt be remembred concerning this cuſtome, that the land newly to be tilled was a wood; ſome of it ſtanding to this day: and all of it called the <hi>Wood-ſield:</hi> and ſo was not lyable formerly according to the cuſtome of England to pay any tithe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in liew of this the Incumbent receives annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of that portion of Gisburne, nine threaves of corne, to wit, ſoure of wheate, if there be ſo much grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ground, and the reſt of barley. The which threaves may amount ſometimes neare to the loſſe in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14963:29"/>
double tithe given from him, and then no doubt did, much of it beeing lately converted from wood to arable; by which it appeares, that the alienation and graunt was not without the conſent of the Biſhop and Incumbent, but with conſent of all parties.</p>
            <p>The other is the cuſtomary payment of foure threaves of corne of every plough-land in the Eaſt-riding of York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, given, as he ſaith, by King Athelſtan to the Church of Saint Iohn of Beverley (which came not, as he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, neere to the tenth) which threaves are ſtiled <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae</hi> in a bull of one of the Pope Gregories, as if <hi>decima</hi> in one notion had ſignified any kinde of revenue devoutly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to holy uſes.</p>
            <p>For anſwer hereof, I muſt confeſſe I cannot fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve my ſelfe of this cuſtome by all the enquiry I have made; yet I ſhall be able I hope to enforme my reader ſo much, as ſhall proove the Hiſtorian much miſtaken in this allegation.</p>
            <p>Firſt if they who have skill in the Saxon dialect may be beleeved, we may as well by [forne thraue] underſtand the fourth threave of every plough-land, as ſimply ſoure; and then here was a greater quantity then a tenth.

But the truth is, I cannot learne or heare of any of the Laity that hold or enjoy any temporall land that paies, or ever paid any ſuch portion to S. Iohn of Beverley, either by the gift of Athelſtan, or any other King; nor that ever King A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelſtan
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14963:30"/>
had any ſuch portion in the Eaſt-riding, payable unto his Avenary by cuſtome of the Country from the Laitie. True it is that there is a cuſtome in the Eaſt-riding called <hi>the payment of threaves;</hi> but of another nature and foundation, and that begun in the daies of Saint Iohn of Beverley, under the raigne, &amp; by the permiſſion and favour of King Athelſtan. The ſtory by tradition is this; The Eaſt-riding, eſpecially the parts about Beverley and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, in regard of the woods and waters, were much annoyed with the hurtfull beaſts called Beavers, Wolves, Otters &amp;c. which deſtroyed dayly their young cattell: the deſtruction whereof the Biſhop having firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at his owne coſt and charges, and in the end find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge to bee too great to be borne by himſelfe, called to his aide &amp; aſſiſtance all the Cleargie of the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding; who gave certaine threaves of corne (every one according to the valuation of his living) ſome more, ſome leſſe; the which was firſt paid in kinde as it grew upon the ground, and brought home either to Beverley, or to places appointed, where men and dogges and horſes were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for this purpoſe; in the ende the evill of beaſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this meanes remooved, and yet this evill cuſtome for the Cleargy remayning, it was changed firſt into the payment of certaine quarters of corne, after into a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary payment, which in valuation is a double tenth, twice ſo much as wee pay annually to the King for tenths, and ſo may not unfitly be called <hi>decimae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howſoever, graunt it were more or leſſe, yet beeing paide onely by the Cleargy, and that out of the tenths of the Church, Pope Gregory might call it fitly <hi>a tenth,</hi> and yet no whit diminiſh the propr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By which particulars it appeares, that the Tithes-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian hath not beene ſo carefully induſtrious to informe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14963:30"/>
himſelfe of the truth of things, or not ſo faithfull to relate them as he doth confidently confeſſe and proteſt, but hath taken what may ſerve for his owne turne and purpoſe, to frame an hiſtory according to his owne intention, &amp; not to the truth: the truth, or true hiſtory of tithes beeing no other then that which is contained in holy writ, and which is no whit ſubject to the Lawes Imperiall, or Canons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synodall or Pontificiall; but containes a law given by God, even like himſelfe, which may not be changed, but muſt remaine one and the ſame throughout all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>The uſe of all which, as it ſerveth to enforce the truth of my generall concluſion, ſo to manifeſt, and manifeſting to reprehend the ſacrilegious impietie of theſe times, wherein men are ſo farre from holding it a duty of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a point of devotion, an argument of thankefulnes to God for his manifold bleſſings, to follow Iacobs example in building and repairing Gods houſe, and truely paying the tenth of what God beſtowes upon them, that they thinke they can doe God &amp; their Countrie no better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then in pulling downe his Churches and Chappels, to rob him of his tithes, and abuſe &amp; wrongfully diſgrace his Miniſters. We have a common Proverbe, that PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER NOSTER <hi>built Churches,</hi> and OVR FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER <hi>puld them downe:</hi> This I confeſſe is contrary to our Profeſſion; but if we will looke to the practiſe of theſe times, we ſhall finde it truely verified: for if we conſider the practiſe of former ages, (I meane not thoſe of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times of Popery, whoſe devotion was ſuperſtition) but thoſe firſt times of the Church of Rome, and thoſe times of other Churches; if, I ſay, we ſhall compare their devotion in erecting and building Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, their zeale in decking and adorning of them, their bounty and liberality for the maintaining of them for time to come, and compare it with our practiſe in theſe our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14963:31"/>
dayes; we ſhall finde that they were not ſo devout to build them, as we have been, and ſtill are, to pull them downe; they were not more zealous to adorne them, then we are to deface them; they were not ſo forward and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall to maintaine them, and the worſhip of God in them, as we are to pill and poll from them. For witneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, how many places of this Land may a man come to, where he ſhall finde moſt goodly and glorious houſes, wrought both within and without with moſt curious workes of the moſt ingenious Artiſts, environed about with all the delights and pleaſures of man; and in the ſame place or pariſh ſhall finde God ſerved in a thatched Church, or wooden Chappell? nay, with griefe let it bee ſpoken, how many ſuch houſes be there, that have been built with the ſtones and morter of the ruines of Gods houſe? how many Churches and Chappels may be found in this Land, which are turned into barnes and ſtables, and to more baſe offices? how many are there againe in this our Land, which are hardly content with the moſt curious needle-workes, the pureſt linnen, and the maſſieſt gold and ſilver for their owne tables, whiles in the meane time, Gods table muſt be content with ſome peice of linſey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> woolſey for a carpet, courſe linnen for a table cloath, &amp; if they will be at coſt for a ſilver chalice, for other veſſels God muſt reſt content with braſſe and pewter, &amp; in many places hardly that. It is recorded of the Iewes in the third of Ezra, that at the building of the ſecond Temple, they amongſt them that had ſeene the firſt Temple, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the glory of it with that they were now to build, burſt forth into mourning and lamentation: ſo if we ſhould paſſe through the parts of this our Countrie, and compare the Churches that are now built, with thoſe that were built in former ages, or thoſe that were built former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with that we may reade or ſee them to have been; it would make the ſtonieſt heart to grieve, and the drieſt eye
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14963:31"/>
to ſhed ſome teares, to behold ſo great a deſolation in Gods Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>And as ſuch and ſo great is the evill will that men have to Gods Sion, in reſpect of the place of his worſhip; ſo no leſſe, nay more in the matter of maintenance and reſpect to his Miniſters, which are ſpeciall meanes to encourage and to enable them for the performance of the parts of his publicke worſhip in thoſe places.</p>
            <p>Not to ſpeake of any Symoniacall contracts, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations, appropriations, cuſtomes, compoſitions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, prohibitions, inhibitions, as things that never trouble mens conſciences, and by which they have, and doe daily rob God and his Church of the beſt part of his ſpirituall inheritance: but to ſpeake onely of that ſmall portion of maintenance which the iniquitie of times hath left yet remaining to the Church; and it is ſtrange but to imagine, what thifts, trickes, and deviſes men have, and all to cooſen God of his right; what ſhifting, what chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and changing from field to field, Pariſh to Pariſh, kinde to kinde; thinking every little too much that the Miniſter enjoyes, and all well gotten that they can deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully get from him: or if their envying that little we have, or the private cooſening of us of what is our due were all, yea if we might have but faire proceeding at the Law for what is violently detained from us, we could hold our ſelves well contented; but to have it violently wreſted out of our hands (or rather Gods) by perjurie, crueltie, and oppreſſion, is an height of impietie more then heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
            <p>For witnes of the truth hereof, how often falls it out that a Pariſhioner diſcontented with his Miniſter, it may be becauſe he cannot have his tithe at his owne rate and pleaſure, or it may be for juſt reprehenſion of him for with-holding Naboths Vineyard, or keeping his brother Phillips wife, or ſome other ſuch like crying ſinne; this

            <p>True it is, that to cloake all this impietie it is pretended that conditionally every Miniſter would be content with one living, and every Church and Chappell might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of an able preaching Miniſter, they could wiſh that there might be a competency allotted out of all livings, impropriations, and other, for the better and ſufficient maintenance of Miniſters therein.

If Chriſt had foretold, that in the latter daies chari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to goe on a little further; why ſhould any man goe about to preſcribe God his allowance, when God himſelfe hath allotted and proportioned it' Is not this for men to make themſelves wiſer then God? Or is it likely that they who now make no conſcience of breaking Gods law in taking from him and his what he hath allotted and given, will make any conſcience to change their owne lawes to leſſen, or wholly take from God and his Church what they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14963:33"/>
themſelves ſhall allow?</p>
            <p>God hath given and allotted us the tenth: the tenth we challenge as Gods and our owne proper due, which no man can detaine without ſacriledge: let them give us that, as God hath given it, and I dare ſay the Church will not onely carefully provide for every Pariſh an able and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient preaching Miniſter, but wee ſhall all reſt our ſelves ſatisfied with one cure of ſoules: yea let us have our tenths duely and truly paid as God commanded, and as we have prooved due; ſo farre ſhall they finde us from covetouſnes, that wee ſhall be willing to reſigne up all our temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (the royalties and dignities of the Church onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:) and yet wee dare maintaine that the Church hath as good right unto them, as any temporall Lord hath to his temporall poſſeſſions, though he can claime them from the donation of Brutus (if any ſuch were) firſt King of great Britaine.</p>
            <p>But for men to talke of a competencie to have every Pariſh provided of a ſufficient preaching Miniſter, and every Miniſter content with one cure of ſoules, and yet they to keepe any part or portion of the tenth in their owne uſe and poſſeſſion, is an evident ſigne that how ſoever this plea of competency beare the ſhew of religion (and I am perſwaded many wiſh and deſire it out of a good heart) yet it is a plaine ſleight of the Devill for the utter overthrow of all pietie and religion by bringing into the Church an equality, by equality to bring in poverty; from whence as followes neceſſarily a contempt of the perſons and calling of Gods Miniſters, ſo no leſſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their doctrine, according to that of Saint Bernard, <hi>Cujus perſona deſpicitur, ejus doctrina contemnitur.</hi>

            <p>Neither are theſe all the evils that attend the Clergy of theſe times, but there bee two particulars more which much helpe to encreaſe their miſeries.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the conſideration of the reaſons alledged why they are not ſo religiouſly devoted and affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gods houſe and Miniſters as formerly; namely, for feare leaſt we ſhould grow rich and proud, and trample upon the Laitie, as in times of Poperie; or leaſt if they ſhould be curious in decking Gods houſe, pious in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and reverencing his Miniſters, they ſhould make way to bring in Poperie and ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>For anſwer, I deny not but the Clergie in times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie were too covetous, too proud, too ſuperſtitious; but becauſe they then fleeced the Laitie, muſt the Laitie now needes fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> the Clergie? becauſe the Pope in his pride trampled on the necke of Kings, muſt every ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who hath but a little more wealth or honour then his neighbours, trample on the heads of our greateſt Clergy? becauſe they were too curious and ſuperſtitious, muſt we needs be careleſſe and irreligious? It ſtands not with our profeſſion, much leſſe with our religion. And as for bringing in of Poperie by this meanes, it is ſo little to be feared, that I dare ſay, the neglect of theſe forenamed particulars, is and hath been the cauſe to hold up the head of Poperie ſo much in theſe Kingdomes: it being a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not onely in Religion, but Nature, that where there is a neglect of Gods houſe, a contempt of his Miniſters, either in withholding that honour and maintenance, or

            <p>The ſecond evill aggravating the miſery of the Church and Churchmen, is the confideration of the perſons who have been &amp; are ſo injurious unto them, who are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lay-men, FILII ALIENI, <hi>Ammon and Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck, the Philiſtins, and thoſe of Tyre, who take the houſes of God into poſſeſſion,</hi> whoſe ſole and greateſt part of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie conſiſts of the revenues of the Church: (for it is no wonder that thoſe maligne us, ſeeing that as a th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

in the gap withhold Gods hand from his fierce judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who (maugre all the ſpight and malice of Satan and his abettors, the enemies of God and his inheritance) are and will be liberall towards the maintenance of his houſe, reſpectfull of his Miniſters, willingly and liberally honouring them both with maintenance and countenance. But alas theſe are but as a gathering after vintage, and a gleaning after harveſt, if you come to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oxpopuli,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cry of the generall number, who either can or will cry no other ſong then that of the Caldeans at the ſacking of Ieruſalem, Downe with Churches, away with tithes, let us trample both them and their Prieſts downe to the ground.</p>
            <p>All which duely conſidered, as it gives all true hearted Chriſtians juſt cauſe to lament and bewaile the wretched and miſerable eſtate and condition of men in theſe times; ſo gives it us no leſſe cauſe to feare, that God hath ſome extraordinary plague or other in ſtore for us, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance will ſpeedily and ſuddenly fall upon us; yea Gods judgments, as a juſt puniſhment of this ſinne, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fal'n upon us. And that it may appeare to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this feare is not cauſeleſſe, this aſſertion truthleſſe, let us take into our conſideration theſe three texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the firſt is that of Deut. 28. 15. 16. 17. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From whence I make this inference, that if he which keepes not all Gods Commandements ſhall be obnoxious and lyable to all theſe curſes (many of them fitly ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the evills of theſe times;) why ſhould not the committing of that ſinne which at once breakes ſeaven of the ten Commandements? For what man can truely ſay he loves, feares, or truſts in God, when hee regards not his houſe, nor his Miniſters; but robbs both him and them of that maintenance which he hath reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for that purpoſe? or how can God bee worſhipped with holy worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how can his Sabbaths be duely &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14963:37"/>
kept; how can we be ſayd to honour our parents, when our ſpirituall Fathers are not onely contemned, but rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of thoſe things which God hath alloted for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maintenance? and laſtly, if to covet not onely Gods, but the Miniſters houſe, wife, maintenance &amp;c. to robbe God of his tithes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that to the grinding of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours faces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not a breach of the 6, 8, and 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, impoſſible it is that they ſhould bee broken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, all theſe conſidered, why may not this ſinne which thus at once violates 7 of the 10, bee the very cauſe, or at leaſt one of the principall cauſes of all the evills that are lately fallen upon us?</p>
            <p>But becauſe generall threats take ſmall place in remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving particular and accuſtomed ſinnes, in the next place view and conſider HAG. 1. and MALACH. 3. the one concerns Gods houſe, the other his tithes, both his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters reſpect and maintenance; where if wee compare the ſinnes and puniſhments there mentioned for thoſe ſinnes, with theſe times, wee ſhall finde them in many points fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anſwer one another.</p>
            <p>For firſt for the ſinnes, was there ever any age wherein men might more truely be ſayd to dwell in ſeiled houſes, and Gods houſe ly waſt; whena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or was there ever any age wherein men might more juſtly be accuſed for robbing God of his tithes and offerings, then this of ours; who robbe him not onely of ſuperſtuities, but of his very tithes of inheritance; allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many places hardly a tenth, nay not a twentieth part even of that which he hath wholly reſerved for him and his?</p>
            <p>And for the puniſhments, they are no leſſe anſwerable:

            <head>¶ A briefe Preſcript to the Appendix.</head>
            <p>AFter this diſcourſe had lain five yeares by me, and had taken it's laſt farwell of me for the Preſſe, and was at the inſtant of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there came to my hands a manuſcript of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Author, written by way of anſwer to Doct. <hi>CARLTON,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>HENRY SPILMAN,</hi> M. <hi>ROBERTS,</hi> and others, the which when I had read over I found it to be a meer invective, written with the pen of ſome malicious <hi>Martin Mar-prelate,</hi> containing as many ſcurrilous raylings as pages, more lies then leafes; and ſo unworthy of anſwer. Yet being certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the friend that brought it, that it paſſed from hand to hand amongst many of our Gentrie in theſe Northern parts, and that with ſo great approbation, that ſome of them were reſolved to have it printed at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the moſt proper place to bring forth ſuch a birth; I thought it would not be altogether unneceſſarie, to adde this briefe anſwer by way of Appendix to my former diſcourſe, that ſo if it came to any of theſe Gentlemens hands (ſeeing both the weakeneſſe and the wickedneſſe of their ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and adored Idoll) they might reforme their errour, and embrace the truth. The ſumme of which diſcourſe, I have drawne into theſe five following heads; the reſidue being, not worth the anſwering, or already anſwered in the former part of this Book</p>

               <p>MOſes in the book of Geneſis ſets downe no Law of Prieſthood, or tithing of force with Gods people in thoſe dayes; therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Melchiſedeck and Iacob, brought to proove the divine right of tithes, proove nothing in this queſtion, that they were of generall and neceſſary uſe in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ſay that the Church of God was then contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, God taught not his Patriarchs <hi>lege ſcriptà,</hi> as<note place="margin">2</note> he did his Church afterward; but <hi>ſpecials inſtinctis,</hi> by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall revelation and inſtinct, which to them was <hi>inſtar le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis ſupra legem,</hi> as ſure and ſtrongly binding as any written law: God himſelfe being their Prieſt, revealing himſelfe &amp; his will by dreams and viſions; and immediately bleſſing his Church, as after he did by his Prieſts and Prophets, <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> under the Laws and by his Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and Paſtors now under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee that hath but halfe an eye may perceive<note place="margin">3</note> that Moſes in his book of Geneſis doth not write an exact continued ſtory of all things, as he doth in his other books, but onely ſo much as may ſhew the continued ſucceſſe of Gods Church from family to family, untill ſuch time as God eſtabliſhed a Nationall church viſible to the eye of the world, together with ſome other occurrences, as were worthy the knowledge of Gods Saints, either to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated or avoyded in all ſucceeding ages: ſo that if there had been mention made of tithes payd but once in that ſtory, it had been ſufficient premiſes to have drawne a neceſſary concluſion for the generall practiſe of thoſe times. But to have two ſuch remarkable examples; the one of Abraham

Theſe two inſtances, I ſay, of Abraham and Iacob rendring to God by way of thankfulneſſe for his bleſſings, not an eighth, ninth, eleventh, or twelfth, but in a <hi>quota</hi> of tenth (the ſame <hi>quota</hi> beeing eſtabliſhed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by God ſo ſoon as ever he ſetled a Church and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) are ſufficient to enforce the generall practiſe, not onely for thoſe times, but for all ſucceding times, ſo long as God ſhould continue a Church or Prieſthood, or at leaſt till he ſhould preſcribe ſome new law to the contrary.</p>
               <p>But againſt theſe inſtances he makes many exceptions. Firſt, againſt the practiſe of Melchiſedeck he alleadgeth,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that this Melchiſedeck was Chriſt himſelfe, appearing in the forme and ſhape of a man, and bleſſing Abraham.</p>
               <p>Firſt, both David and Paul croſſe this aſſertion, who<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, ſay we ſhould graunt this; what would then<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Solut.</hi> 2.</note> follow, but that Chriſt (beeing the <hi>everlaſting Biſhop of our ſoules, the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever;</hi> upon whoſe Prieſthood all other Prieſthoods have ſole depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; of whom all other Prieſts are either types, or to whom they are ſubſtitutes) bleſſing Abraham, &amp; receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tithes in lieu thereof, in the perſon, office, and order of Prieſthood, and that before the Law eſtabliſhed, muſt needs inferre the payment of tithes in their <hi>quotá</hi> to Chriſt and his Prieſts throughout all generations? Yea, to have a <hi>Prieſt</hi> no ſooner named in the book of God, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14963:45"/>
                  <hi>tithes to him paid,</hi> doth ſo neceſſarily conjoyne them, that none but he that will make himſelfe a profeſſed enemie to Chriſt and his Prieſts can disjoyne them.</p>
               <p>But we reade that the Egyptians had Prieſts who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<note place="margin">Object.</note> no tithes; therefore Prieſts and tithes are not <hi>relata</hi> ſo neceſſarily conjoyned.</p>
               <p>How prooves he this aſſertion? Wee finde mention onely of their lands, &amp; allowance made by the King in the time of famine; therefore they had no tithes. Martin Mar-prelate to a haire.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould not Moſes his mentioning tithes payd by<note place="margin">Solut.</note> Abraham and vowed by Iacob, as well proove the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for the practiſe of Gods Church and people for the payment of Tithes? or what hath Baal and his ſervice to doe with God and his ſervice? I have read that the heathen have been Apes to Gods people, for the manner of divine worſhip, but never that the Saints were to be regulated by the heathen. But to ſhape an anſwer to the objection, why may not I ſay that the King of Egypt receiving a fifth part of all increaſe of his land, included in that fifth the Prieſts tenth; maintaining them in the time of dearth out of his owne ſtore? By which meanes hee did not onely take from the Prieſts the envy of the people, but maintained them &amp; theirs better then otherwayes their lands &amp; tithes would have done. Sure I am that many a Miniſter in theſe dayes who hath a competent living in time of plenty, would be glad the King would take the like care for him in time of ſcarcity: all that he can ſay againſt me is but a <hi>non eſt ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> Moſes writes not ſo much: howſoever ſure I am there is a <hi>ſcriptum eſt,</hi> firſt againſt his ſacriledge; for when the King bought all the land of his people, hee bought not the Prieſts land: ſecondly againſt his contributary compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; for the Egyptian Prieſts lived not of the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, but had lands of their owne, and when thoſe lands were not able to releive them, the King left
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14963:45"/>
them not to the mercy of the people, but maintained them out of his owne ſtore.</p>
               <p>Againſt the practiſe of Iacob hee thus reaſons; Vowes<note place="margin">Object.</note> are to bee made onely of things indifferent, ſuch things as are in our power to doe, or not to doe; but Iacob vowed tithes; therefore the payment of tithes is not neceſſary but a thing indifferent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I anſwer that the law of vowing or vowes, was<note place="margin">Solut.</note> made after Iacob, and therefore if there were any ſuch clauſe in it, yet it bound not Iacob: if hee ſay the law made by Moſes ſerves as a rule for all ages, why then not the law of tithing, which he cannot deny, but under the Law was a duty neceſſary? But to draw neer to an anſwer, Vowes, ſaith the Author, were to be made of things onely indifferent, not neceſſary. I aske then whether wee may ſweare to the performance of things neceſſary; if we may, then wee may vowe to performe whatſoever wee may ſweare to performe: but wee may ſweare the performance of things neceſſary: <hi>ergò.</hi>

               <p>Obedience to Kings is a thing neceſſary, ROM. 13. 1; but we may ſweare obedience to Kings. To forſake the Devill and all his workes is a duty neceſſary; but wee may not onely vowe this in baptiſme, but take the Sacrament after to binde us to the performance of that vowe: nay if wee may not vowe things neceſſary, why did Iacob vowe that the Lord ſhould be his God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> And whereas vowes are defined to bee <hi>promiſſiones ſpontaneae</hi> voluntary promiſes and actions, they are not ſo tearmed in relation to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and matter of the things vowed, but to the perſons vowing, and the law whereby no man is bound ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to make a vowe of any thing. But for the thing vowed, if it be a thing in it's owne nature lawfull to be done, be it of things neceſſary or indifferent, it muſt be performed; As for the inſtance of Iephta's, Saul's, and the Iſraelites vowes, the things vowed were unlawfull and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14963:46"/>
therefore proove nothing to this queſtion.</p>
               <p>But tithes were Gods owne before, as is alleadged; then<note place="margin">Object.</note> was it idleneſſe in Iacob to vow them. And hee confirmes his aſſertion thus; God forbad the children of Iſrael to vow their firſt borne, becauſe they were his owne before.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay as before, that a law made many yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Solut.</note> bindes not for the time paſt. Secondly, obſerve the wickedneſſe of this man, who rather then Iacobs practiſe ſhall be of force to proove the divine right of tithes, will make Iacob to be both an idle and wicked companion, doing things not onely unneceſſary, but unlawfull. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuppoſe God had made ſuch a law concerning the firſt borne; what is that to tithes, unleſſe God had made the like law for them? Fourthly, where doth he finde ſuch a law, wherein God forbad the Iſraelites to vowe their firſt borne, becauſe they were his? I read in the laſt of Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus of ſuch a lawe made concerning the firſtlings of beaſts, as of oxen and ſheep, but not of man or ought els; nay, in the ſame Chapter and elſwhere, God gives expreſſe command for the ſanctification of the firſt borne of man, though not for the office of Prieſthood, as before: becauſe Levi was now choſen to that office; yet to be at Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall and command. And for the lawfulneſſe of vowing the firſt borne, it is evident in Annas vowing Samuel. Laſtly, in the ſaid Chapter there is a law of tithing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed both for <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner, what</hi> and <hi>how</hi> they ought to be paid, and how to be redeemed. But nothing either in that place, or any els impugnes the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of vowing them to the Lord. And thus much for the firſt argument.</p>

And for the truth of his concluſion, I may as well reaſon thus; Set times of prayer, of preaching, and adminiſtring the Sacraments are of humane conſtitution; therefore prayers, preaching, and the Sacraments are humane. But I ſee the drift of this Gentleman; he would have both humane and divine Law to binde all Gods Miniſters ſtrictly to their task of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. but the people at libertie what to give them for their paines, or at moſt, bound onely by mans law, which this Gentleman and thoſe of his opinion hold themſelves bound to obſerve no longer then they ſhall like and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove of their Miniſters.

               <p>God eſtabliſhed no ſpeciall law for the puniſhment of<note place="margin">Object.</note> ſuch as ſhould detaine tithes; therefore they were not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.

ſinne in ſpeciall. Or if this anſwer will not ſatisfy, I adde further, that as Solon ordaining lawes, made none againſt the ſinne of Paricide, becauſe he thought no man could be ſo inhumanely cruell, as to commit it: ſo God (I ſpeake with reverence to his preſcience and omniſcience) thought no man to bee ſo graceleſly unthankfull, as to deny a tenth to him from whome he received the whole; and therefore made no law for the puniſhment of ſuch often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

               <p>The firſt was called the tithe of inheritance, or the

                  <hi>tithe of all the increaſe of the ſeed that the field brought forth every yeare,</hi> DEVT. 14 22. together with a tenth of whatſoever paſſed under the rod, or what els they poſſeſſed; This was ſeparated in the field before they might bring ought into the barne, or might intermedle with any thing for thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond is mentioned DEVT. 14. 23. and was called the <hi>ſecond tithe,</hi> which was a full tenth of the nine parts, remaining after the deduction of the firſt tenth, and which was to be eaten before the Lord, in the place wherein he ſhould put his name, by the Owners, Prieſts and Levites, at the time of their publick Feaſts and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne aſſemblies: And both theſe were to be payd year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; neither might the people uſe any of the reſt till ſuch time as theſe two tithes were ſeparated from it; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof might be changed into money, verſ. 25. but the former not.</p>
               <p>The third was a third tenth payable onely every third yeare, and ſo was called the <hi>tithe</hi> of the <hi>third yeare,</hi> which was a tenth part, for <hi>quota,</hi> out of the eight parts remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the two former tithes firſt deducted; which was layd up within the gates of their ſeverall Cities for the releiſe of <hi>the Levite, the ſtranger, fatherleſſe, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes within their gates;</hi> DEVT. 14. 28. 29.</p>

                     </gap>,</hi> the tenth of a tenth, the tenth part of the tithe of inheritance, offered by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites as an heave-offering to the Lord for the uſe of Aaron the Prieſt, and accounted to the Levites as the increaſe of the threſhing-ſloor, and the increaſe of the winepreſſe: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, and not before, they might account the tithes their owne, which they might lawfully eat in every place with their houſhoulds.</p>
               <p>In which particular donation and conſtitution three thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14963:48"/>
though it were the corne of the threſhing-ſloore, and the fulneſſe of the winepreſſe. Secondly, they might not without ſinne rate any of their tithes before they had paid out this tithe; intimating in my poor judgement thus much unto the Levites, that when the time ſhould come that the Prieſthood ſhould ceaſe from their Tribe, and themſelves ceaſe from the ſervice of the Tabernacle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying inheritance of lands, and dreſſing and tilling them as the reſt of their brethren; yet then ſhould not all Prieſthood ceaſe, nor tithes to that Prieſthood, nor yet might they exempt themſelves from paying tithes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were deſcended from Levi's loynes; but they ſhould pay a full tenth of their come and wine, and other ſubſtance, as they formerly had done out of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of tithes, unto whomſoever it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to conferre the office of Prieſthood; neither ſhould they account ought their owne, untill they had ſo paid their tithes. Thirdly, this tenth being paid, it was lawfull for them to eate the reſt, not onely at Ieruſalem, but in any other place where their houſhold remained. So much for the Wages.</p>
               <p>The Service of the Tabemacle was ſuch as the Prieſts and Levites were to performe, either about, within, or without the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>By their ſervice about the Tabernacle, I underſtand the preparing of it for carriage, and the bearing thereof. NVMB. 4.</p>
               <p>Their ſervice within the Tabernacle, was partly Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall and Typicall, and partly Morall.</p>
               <p>The Ceremoniall was either of the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the Tabernacle of Witneſſe, EXOD. 25. or <hi>Sanctum,</hi> the Tabernacle of the Congregation, EXOD. 26.

LEVIT. 1. 2. 3. peace-offerings, LEVIT. 3. 1. 6. ſinne-offerings, LEVIT. 2. 4. 5. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Morall ſervice within the Tabernacle, I call reading and expounding the Law, the celebration of publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, bleſſing the people at the end of ſolemne aſſemblies, &amp;c. unto which I may add the power of the execution of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures.</p>
               <p>Their ſervice without the Tabernacle was either Civill and Iudiciall, conſiſting in the hearing &amp; determining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of controverſie in all the quarters of Iſraell, for the better maintenance of piety and religion; or els Morall, as the teaching &amp; inſtructing their children in their ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cities in the knowledge of the ſeverall lawes, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſit them for the ſervice of the Tabernacle, being Maſters of the Schools; or els in reading and expounding the Law, and celebrating of publick prayers out of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, remote from the Tabernacle, either within their owne Cities, whereunto the Iewes generally reſorted on Sabbath daies and at other times appointed (as ſome are of opinion) or els within the ſeverall Cities of Iudah and Iſraell, as may be gathered by that charge ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by the Lord, <hi>to have ſpeciall reſpect to the Levites within their gates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of theſe ſervices, ſome were proper to the Prieſts, ſome to the Levites, ſome common to both. The which who ſo deſires to know, ſhall finde them in the books of Moſes, and 1. CHRON. 9. 23.</p>
               <p>From theſe premiſes theſe Concluſions will follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Tithes were not given to the Levites, as the ſonnes of Levi, but becauſe God had ſelected that Tribe for the<note place="margin">Numb. 18. 1. 2. 3. 6.</note> office of the Prieſthood, and ſervice of the Tabernacle, and as aſſiſtants to the Prieſts in the celebration of Divine worſhip: So if I graunt (which you cannot deny) that Prieſts &amp; Divine worſhip ſtand in force; then tithes muſt neceſſarily be yeelded as due. And I preſume this is one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14963:49"/>
chiefe reaſon, why the name of <hi>Prieſt</hi> is ſo odious to the Laity, becauſe it infers a neceſſity of payment of <hi>tithes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the donation of tithes of inheritance, under the name of the Levites family is included Aaron &amp; his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as may appeare, not onely becauſe they communicated with them in their tithes, but all the places of Scripture wherin the graunt is made, enforce no leſſe, as will appeare by comparing of places, DEVT. 10. NV MR. 18. 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So farre forth as the Prieſthood and ſervice thereof was Leviticall, &amp; tyed to a certain Tribe, family, number, habit, forme, and externall order of Legall ſervice, yea in all reſpects wherin it was a Type of Chriſt, or had ought to doe with things Typicall, So it is ceaſed, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The tithes of inheritance were not given ſimply for the ſervice of the Altar, nor yet for carrying of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, by which ſervice this Author and all men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtand the ſervice of the Tabernacle. For firſt, the ſervice of the Altar was proper to the Prieſts onely, NV MB. 13. Secondly, in lieu of the ſervice of the Altar the Prieſts had an other allowance, and that by Gods ſpeciall appointment, NV MB. 18. DEVT. 18. which allowance, for the <hi>quota,</hi> is ceaſed together with that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Thirdly, if tithes had been the wages of the ſervice of the Altar, then thoſe onely who had been imployed in this ſervice had been partakers thereof; but not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe imployed about and within the Tabernacle and Temple, but thoſe without might partake of tithes, <hi>ergo &amp;c.</hi> Neither could the carrying of the Tabernacle be the ſervice; for the Levites ceaſed from that ſervice after fifty yeares of age, during the continuance of the Tabernacle; and after the eſtabliſhment of the Temple, this ſervice cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, 1.

               <p n="5">5. It remaineth that the ſervice, for which tithes were properly given, was reading the Law, expounding
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14963:49"/>
the Law, performing of publick prayers, with the reſt of the Morall and Iudiciall ſervice both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Theſe ſervices are the ſame for ſubſtance under the Goſpel, as they were under the Law, and as neceſſarily required of the Prieſts and Miniſters now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as they were under the Law of the Prieſts &amp; Levites; therefore, the ſervice being the ſame by this Adverſaries owne confeſſion, the wages muſt needs be the ſame.</p>

               <p>THe fourth maine objection is drawne from the ſmall<note place="margin">Object.</note> number of Miniſters now under the Goſpel, in reſpect of thoſe under the Law; the Prieſts and Levites being a twelfth part of the Iſraelites, whereas now they are hardly the hundreth part of the people; and it is not like that God would allow ſo great a portion of maintenance to ſo ſmall a number. This is an uſuall Argument both with this Author, and frequent in the mouthes of all Decato-maſticks.</p>
               <p>To which I firſt anſwer, that howſoever the number of<note place="margin">Solut.</note> Miniſters be not the ſame, yet God is the ſame, &amp; his right in tithes is the ſame; and may not God do what he liſt with his owne? Gods waies are not as mans, neither is he bound to means, or alligated to number; but he can worke as well by few, as by many; much leſſe is he bound to beſtow thoſe things which are his, according to mans judgement, or at mans appointment. Suppoſe God had choſen onely Aaron and his family to receive his part of tithes, as he did to the office of Prieſthood; had it not been as great a ſinne for the Iſraelites to have denyed them tithes, becauſe their number was ſo ſmall, as it was for Korah, Dathan, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram to conteſt with them about their office of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? And no leſſe a ſinne doe they commit, who make this an argument to infringe Gods right of tithes to his Miniſters, becauſe they are fewer then were the Prieſts and Levites.</p>
               <p>2. I cannot chooſe but wonder that this Author, or any of his ſtrain, ſhould make this an argument to oppoſe the right of tithes, when as in their right underſtandings, and when they ſpeake the truth from their hearts, they think the number of Prieſts that receive tithes in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14963:50"/>
theſe daies to be too great; yea, conditionally they might ſave their tithes, could be content there were no Prieſts, but that every man might bee a Prieſt to his owne family; preferring private conventicles before publick Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, were the maintenance for Miniſters more, their number would ſoon increaſe: Let the times of Popery ſpeake for <hi>England,</hi> when as the Church had gotten a third of the land into their poſſeſſions (and the like we may ſee in other Countries) and I doubt not, but if there were now the like maintenance, the name of <hi>Prieſt</hi> now ſo odious, would be held a name honourable.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If wee ſhall examine the number of the Prieſts and Levites with their maintenance, as their firſt fruites, their <hi>Therumab,</hi> their two tenths, and portion in the tithe of the third yeare, their parts and portion of ſacrifices, with their devoted oblations and freewill-offerings, and all theſe brought home at the coſt &amp; charges of the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to theſe add their 48 Cities with their ſuburbs, and compare them with our number and maintenance; it will appeare that, for their number, their maintenance exceeded ours in theſe times, though we ſhould pay the full tenth without fraud, coven, or deceit.</p>
               <p>Had God now under the Goſpel made us partakers of worſe things, &amp; a meaner Miniſtry then he did the Iewes under the Law, &amp; with all had bound us to the like mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for his Miniſters, we might have had cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine; but for God to exceed in his bleſſings, to make us partakers of better things, and give us a more glorious Miniſtry, and yet not to require a tithe of that he required of the Iewes; to grudge and repine to render to God ſo ſmall a pittance by way of thankfulneſſe for ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bleſſings, ſavours more then Iewiſh covetouſnes, heatheniſh impietie and ſacriledge.</p>

               <p>THe fift and laſt argument is layd downe by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication<note place="margin">Object.</note> to an allegation made for to proove the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of tithes, taken from the Iudgements of God inflicted in all ages upon Impropriators and ſacrilegious perſons; to which he thus replyeth, That if Miniſters chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who live upon tithes were examined, they would be found as very unthrifts, as the children of Impropriators.</p>
               <p>By which, as he ſhews his true love to the poore Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,<note place="margin">Solut.</note> ſo his great weakneſſe, greater wickednes: for we aſcribe neither the Childrens wickednes, nor unthriftines, to their Fathers ſacriledge; nor the conſumption of their eſtates, to their owne unthriftines: we acknowledge that grace and godlines is the gift of God in Regeneration, not of their fathers in Generation; ſo that oftentimes the beſt of men, not onely Miniſters, but others, have moſt graceles children, <hi>&amp; è contrà.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Though true it be, that oftentimes this is the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py caſe of Gods Miniſters, and the oftner by reaſon of the Impropriators detaining the means, whereby they ſhould both maintaine themſelves and educate their children; or otherwiſe by other wicked practiſes, ſuits, and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of malicious and factious ſpirits, whereby they are not only diverted from the duties of their callings, but from the care of their private families; yet it is not the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall caſe of all Miniſters children, but God be bleſſed there are and have been in all ages happy ſucceſſions of their children for divers generations. But he cannot inſtance the like in the children of Impropriators, for they have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally fayled in all places and ages.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the wonderment in this particular is not becauſe their children are unthrifts, but this, that their children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſhew as great good husbands as their Forefathers, yet their eſtates by a third generation are utterly waſted and conſumed, or their names wholly extinct; ſo that they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14963:51"/>
are forced to confeſſe for the juſtification of themſelves the truth of that of Solomon, The holy thing left by their fathers, or gotten by themſelves, hath privily eaten up both it ſelfe and all their other ſubſtance.
